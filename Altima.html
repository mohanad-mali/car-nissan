            <td  style="padding: 7px;" > .Cabin and seats :
                The Nissan Altima seats five people and its front seats are among the best in its class. Nissan considers using NASA technology to provide better cushioning and support for the body. The seats are wide, beautifully shaped, comfortable, and protect the body from fatigue after long periods behind the wheel. However, the rear seats do not get the same treatment, but they are still comfortable enough for two adults and three if they are cramped.

                <hr style="color: blue;">
                <li>Loading space :
                It has 15.4 cubic feet of trunk space, which is average for a mid-sized car and provides enough space to carry a few small bags or a couple of larger suitcases. The rear seats can be folded to make it easier to store longer items.</li>

                <hr style="color: blue;">
                <li>Engine transmission and performance :
                2024 Nissan Altima is offered with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 188 horsepower and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 248 horsepower. A continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive are standard, and a four-wheel drive system is optional</li>

                <hr style="color: blue;">

                <li>Acceleration :
                2.5 liter 4 cylinder engine Acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 8 second Top speed of 223 km/h</li>

                <hr style="color: blue;">

                <li>oil consumption :
                A 2.5-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine that generates 188 horsepower and 244 Nm of torque.</li>

            <td style="padding: 7px;" > 
                <li>. There is no AWD in the sporty model of the 2023 Altima
                    Like the competing K5 and Camry, the 2023 Altima is only available with all-wheel drive if you stick with the 188-hp four-cylinder base engine.
                    
                    This also means you don't get the SR's upgraded suspension and larger wheels and tires. Midsize sedan enthusiasts looking for lively acceleration to go along with the added traction of all-wheel drive have only one option in this class: the Subaru Legacy with the optional 260-hp, turbocharged 2.4-liter V6.</li>

                    <hr style="color: blue;">

                <li>. Motion vector
                    Nissan has long been a believer in continuously variable automatic transmissions to increase smoothness and fuel economy, if often at the expense of a sporty driving experience. The updated Altima is no exception. Downsides to the CVT include a sort of mushy feel rather than positive gear changes, as well as a certain amount of droney driving as engine rpm rises when the car accelerates. As part of its mission to be a sporty Altima, the SR gets paddle shifters to help emulate the feel of a traditional automatic transmission, but it's not the same.</li>

                    <hr style="color: blue;">

                <li>. Technical difficulties
                    The larger touchscreen enhances what was already one of the best infotainment systems on the market, but it's strange that Nissan didn't upgrade the rearview camera at the same time.
                    
                    The camera is disappointing for the Damon, with lower resolution than most other new cars. Additionally, the Altima's lane departure warning system includes an intervention feature that's a little more vigilant than we'd like, gently applying the brakes for a moment when a wheel crosses a lane marker.</li>

                
                
            .</td>
            <td  style="padding: 7px;"> <li>service works with the MyNissan smartphone app and allows user-controlled locking/unlocking and engine start/stopping of mounting vehicles. Nissan will continue to offer the Altima in 4WD and 4WD vehicles for 2024. The Altima chat costs $29,125 and a US subscription.</li>
