        <td  style="padding: 7px;" >The Nissan Maxima 2024 has many features that make it an ideal car for lovers of speed, comfort and elegance, and among these features are:

            Advanced and diverse technology includes a large touch screen that controls all the car's functions, a 360-degree camera system, a smart driver assistance system, a fingerprint operating system, and a keyless start system.
            
            Luxurious and comfortable cabin offers ample space for passengers and luggage with high-quality materials, comfortable heated and cooled seats and a Bose Premium audio system with 11 speakers.

        <td style="padding: 7px;" >Despite all the advantages that the Nissan Maxima 2024 has, it is not free from some defects that may affect the purchase decision, and among these defects are:

            High price compared to some competing cars in the same category, such as Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Ford Fusion.
            
            High fuel consumption compared to some hybrid or electric cars, such as the Toyota Prius, Tesla Model 3, and Chevrolet Volt.
            
            Front-wheel drive only, which reduces the car's ability to handle rough or slippery roads.
            
            Small luggage space compared to some larger trunk cars like the Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, and Volkswagen Passat.</td>
        <td  style="padding: 7px;" >The base Maxima SV starts at $39,235, and the Maxima SR starts at $44,395. That's up $300 for both compared to 2022, but the range-topping 2023 Nissan Maxima Platinum is $1,100 more expensive, starting at $45,345. All prices include a mandatory $1,095 destination fee.</td>
